    Cats are clearly the better house pet, for many reasons... <br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li> Cats for the most part are perfectly happy staying indoors. <br>
            You won’t need to worry coming home early to let them outside! <br>
            They actually might even prefer when you’re out… <br></li>
        <li>Having a pest problem? If you already have a cat you probably answered no to that question. <br>
            Cats will keep all the mice and bugs away from your house! <br>  </li>
        <li> Other than when it’s time to eat, cats are far quieter than dogs. You won’t have to worry when <br>
            the mail man stop by, cats won’t be causing a scene. <br> </li>
        <li>Now, though it might be strange that your cat has a little house inside specifically to use the bathroom, <br>
          you won’t have to go outside in the middle of winter like someone with a dog would. <br> </li>
          <li> if there is one thing dogs love, it'r rolling in the mud! <br>
        cats on the otherhand, hate it. They love staying clea, and eve give themselves their own baths. <br> </li>
    </ol>
    For these reasons, cats make the best house pet! <br>
