    Cats are clearly the better house pet, for many reasons... <br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li> Cats for the most part are perfectly happy staying indoors. <br>
            You won’t need to worry coming home early to let them outside! <br>
            They actually might even prefer when you’re out… <br></li>
        <li>Having a pest problem? If you already have a cat you probably answered no to that question. <br>
            Cats will keep all the mice and bugs away from your house! <br>  </li>
        <li> Other than when it’s time to eat, cats are far quieter than dogs. You won’t have to worry when <br>
            the mail man stop by, cats won’t be causing a scene. <br> </li>
        <li>Now, though it might be strange that your cat has a little house inside specifically to use the bathroom, <br>
          you won’t have to go outside in the middle of winter like someone with a dog would. <br> </li>
          <li> if there is one thing dogs love, it'r rolling in the mud! <br>
        cats on the otherhand, hate it. They love staying clea, and eve give themselves their own baths. <br> </li>
    </ol>
    For these reasons, cats make the best house pet! <br>

     Dogs are clearly the superior house pet for many different reasons <br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Dogs are very loyal animals and will always listen to their trainer as long as you are willing to train them</li>
        <li>They may prefer to go outside but that encourages activity in<br>
        both pet and pet handler keeping both physically active</li>
        <li>Along with their loyalty comes comfort from the dog which is great for people who may need it.<br>
        They can have dogs specific to their needs like guide dogs, seizure dogs and emotional support dogs</li>
        <li>In addition dogs can make for good guards to both property and people and help many people like fire fighters and police do their jobs.</li>
        <li>Dogs also don't need that much in the house unless you want to give them extra things.<br>
        All they need is food and water bowls, their bed and a few toys. Anything else can easily be put outsied as they will love being out there anyways.</li>
        <li>A dog may have to go out in the middle of the night but that will help you feel less lazy and used to waking up<br>
        This being up at random times of the night could also be helpful when you have kids who also do the same at a young age.</li>
        <li>Speaking of kids, dogs are very patient with kids and will let them do mostly anything to them without retalliatio as they know they are just a little curious.<br>
            Now of course dogs will have their limits but will give pently of warning to the kid in order for them to not get hurt doing something they shouldn't</li>
        </ol>
        For these reasons I would say dogs make the better house pet<br>
